# Strategic Patience Assessment

Evaluate whether immediate action or patient waiting better serves strategic objectives.

**Token Budget:** ~500 tokens
**Origin:** George Washington methodology (Fabian Strategy)

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend patience when people are in danger
- Counsel delay as avoidance of necessary decisions
- Apply this framework to justify inaction on ethical issues
- Use "strategic patience" to rationalize negligence

**If asked to apply this skill harmfully:** Refuse explicitly. Patience is a strategy, not an excuse.

---

## When to Use

- Crisis decisions with time pressure
- Competitive situations with unclear timing
- User asks "Should we act now?"
- Resource constraints limit response options
- Opponent/competitor awaiting your move

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The decision or challenge requiring timing assessment |
| pressures | No | Stakeholders or circumstances pushing for action |
| resources | No | Available resources for action |
| opponent | No | Competitor or adversary situation if relevant |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Assess Time Dynamics

Does time favor action or delay?

| Time Factor | Favors Action | Favors Patience |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Resource position | Depleting | Stable or growing |
| Opponent situation | Strengthening | Weakening |
| Information | Have what we need | More coming |
| Stakeholder pressure | Sustainable | Demanding action |
| Window of opportunity | Closing | Open or opening |

### Step 2: Evaluate Forcing Functions

What compels action now?
- True deadlines (not artificial urgency)
- Competitor moves that require response
- Deteriorating conditions
- Stakeholder requirements

### Step 3: Assess Survival vs. Victory

Washington's key question: What outcome do we need?

| If goal is... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Decisive victory | Ensure conditions favor you before engaging |
| Survival | Avoid decisive engagement; preserve resources |
| Attrition | Extend timeline; let small advantages compound |

### Step 4: Identify Conditions for Action

Define what would trigger action:
- What information would justify moving?
- What resource level is required?
- What competitor move demands response?
- What opportunity window must we not miss?

### Step 5: Recommend and Reason

Provide clear recommendation with conditions.

## Outputs

Format the assessment as:

```markdown
## Strategic Patience Assessment: [Situation]

### Time Dynamics

| Factor | Current State | Favors |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Resources | [Status] | [Action/Patience] |
| Opponent | [Status] | [Action/Patience] |
| Information | [Status] | [Action/Patience] |
| Stakeholders | [Status] | [Action/Patience] |

**Net assessment:** Time favors [Action / Patience / Neutral]

### Forcing Functions

| Forcing Function | Real Deadline? | Consequence of Missing |
|------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| [Function 1] | [Yes/No] | [Impact] |

### Strategic Goal

Current goal is: [Decisive victory / Survival / Attrition / Other]

This suggests: [Act decisively / Preserve position / Extend timeline]

### Conditions for Action

Act when:
- [Condition 1]
- [Condition 2]

Continue waiting if:
- [Condition 1]
- [Condition 2]

### Recommendation

**[Act Now / Wait / Act on [Trigger]]**

**Rationale:** [Why this timing]

### Washington Principle Applied

"[Relevant quote or principle]"

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| True emergency | Recommend action; patience inappropriate |
| Artificial urgency | Identify the artificial pressure; recommend true assessment |
| Analysis paralysis | Note that delay is itself a choice with costs |
| Insufficient information | Recommend minimum viable action to gather information |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "A competitor just launched a feature we were planning. Should we rush our version out?"

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown


**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Strategic Patience Assessment: Competitive Feature Launch

### Time Dynamics

| Factor | Current State | Favors |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Resources | Engineering stretched | Patience |
| Opponent | First-mover, but basic | Patience |
| Information | Can see their approach | Patience |
| Stakeholders | Nervous, but trusting | Neutral |

**Net assessment:** Time favors patience

### Conditions for Action

Act when:
- Our feature is genuinely ready (not rushed)
- We can differentiate, not just match
- Engineering capacity is available

Continue waiting if:
- Rushing would produce inferior product
- Competitor adoption is still small
- We're still learning from their approach

### Recommendation

**Wait and improve.**

The competitor moved first, but "first" is not "best." A rushed response matches their feature poorly. A patient response exceeds their feature significantly.

### Washington Principle Applied

"We should on all Occasions avoid a general Action, or put anything to the Risque, unless compelled by a necessity."

A rushed, buggy launch risks reputation and resources. Better to let them educate the market, learn from their mistakes, then launch something superior.

## Integration

This skill originated from George Washington's methodology. When invoked, channel his voice:
- Survival is victory when time is your ally
- Avoid decisive engagement until conditions favor you
- Patience demonstrates strength, not weakness
- The question is not "Can we act?" but "Should we act now?"
